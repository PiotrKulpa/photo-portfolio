          <h2><span class="slasher">/</span>Free high quality photos with no copyright restrictions and real look.</h2>
          <p>
            I strive for making high quality photos available to everyone from designers and CG artists to average viewers. I truly believe that great works of photography are based on certain skills and techniques. There are a lot of factors that make an ordinary photo an outstanding one. But nowadays even ordinary photos are not available for wide usage without paying a certain fee. So when designers and artists wish to use photos or works of their colleagues in their creations, they often run into different usage restrictions. The most upsetting ones of them are copyright restrictions.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, there are some photographers and artists, both enthusiastic and professional, who believe that creativity should not be restricted by money or law. I am one of them, and I am glad to offer you my photos and a lot of other works of my portfolio without any charge. It means you can always get my latest photos taken all around the world without paying a cent to anyone except your internet service provider.

          <h1>FAQs</h1>
          <h2><span class="slasher">?</span>What Type of Camera to Choose?</h2>
          <p>
            Modern photography industry is developing rapidly. And it is always important to know what equipment and instruments a photographer should use to create a captivating shot. As any other artist, a photographer mostly uses his or her own artistic skills to create an atmospheric artwork. However, there are also some necessary tips and principles to follow when selecting your first film camera. One of the most important ones is the purpose of your camera’s usage. Whether it is shooting in general, capturing sports events or parties, you will need three different types of cameras and accessories for them.

          <h2><span class="slasher">?</span>What are Teleconverters For?</h2>
          <p>
            A teleconverter or tele extender is a special type of film camera accessory, designed to enlarge the central part of an image, obtained by an objective lens. It helps photographers to make amazing shots at great distances. Teleconverter increases apparent focal length of your camera, and it can be used with both analog and digital cameras. While there are hundreds of teleconverters available, it may seem quite hard to find an appropriate one, but I recommend using teleconverters from manufacturer of your camera.

          <h2><span class="slasher">?</span>How to Shoot Without Flash?</h2>
          <p>
            Many modern photographers find it difficult to deal with situations where venue does not allow using flash to finish their idea and implement it in a breathtaking shot. There are a variety of venues and objects that do not allow using flash both as an instrument and accessory for your camera because of its bad effect it may have on the object of your shot. However, even with such limited possibilities in shooting, you can make amazing shots without any troubles. Professional photographers recommend changing the ISO setting (of course, if you have such a function in your camera). The setting should be set as high as possible, because it makes the sensor of your camera more sensitive to light. As you can see, the more the level of sensitivity is, the better your shot without flash will be. Moreover, you can use additional software to make your images shot without flash look really spectacular. The same can be done to films in analog cameras. In this case you need to use an 800 ISO film, while setting ISO to 1600. Don’t forget that you are “underexposing” the film, so when developing it, it is obligatory to explain what manipulations you have done, so that you could get a perfect result from a developed shot. It helps to reach the same effect. You should also remember that the works of art almost of all kinds do not allow using flash in your camera. But if you are not sure whether you should use it or not, it is always better to consult authorized representatives of the venue.
